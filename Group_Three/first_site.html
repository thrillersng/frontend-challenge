            <p>This is another place where i will write things... this place is just for the main content on the web page
                If you open most web pages or most websites you will discover that some do not have advert pages at the
                right side of the page. Sometimes it could just be a single page site.
            </p>
            <p>OVer time when the owner of the site starts getting traffic i.e. people start rushing their sites, companies tend
                to take note of them and offer them huge sum of money to advertise their products on the site. this is when the third column
                comes in handy. so for a standard website, advert pages or sites shows up on the right side and while for the left side it
                shows some sort of contents thing or so. i'm not too sure

            <p>finally, place is usually for advert most of the time. But i have noticed that most websites
                usually don't usually have adverts. this is because they are new and they've not gotten any sponsors yet
                so they are still learners
